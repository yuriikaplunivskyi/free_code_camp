##It's time to learn about binary numbers

Binary numbers are a base-2 number system. Unlike the base-10 or decimal number system we use every day that uses 10 digits (0-9) to form numbers, the binary number system only has two digits, 0 and 1. In computer science, these binary digits are called bits, and are the smallest unit of data computers can process. For computers, 0 represents false or "off", and 1 represents true or "on".
